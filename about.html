		<h1>About BEMNext Lab</h1>
		<p>The BEMNext Laboratory is a new laboratory set up in 2011 to research and develop the next generation of Built Environment Modelling (BEM) â€“ the modelling, computation, simulation, analysis, optimisation, management, etc. of data, information and knowledge in the built environment to obtain better design, better processes in the building, engineering and construction industry.</p>
		<p>Previously, we were known to be part of the Structural Design Lab (<a href="http://www.structuraldesignlab.citg.tudelft.nl" sl-processed="1">http://www.structuraldesignlab.citg.tudelft.nl</a>) where we were involved in the computation research.</p>
		<p>The BEMNext Laboratory is located at Delft University of Technology, the faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, at the Department of Building and Structural Engineering.</p>
		<p><a title="People" href="http://bemnext.org/about/people/" sl-processed="1">Information about our staff and students can be found here</a>.</p>
		<p>The laboratory is financially supported by Arup (<a href="http://www.arup.com" sl-processed="1">http://www.arup.com</a>), the Cornelis Lely Stichting (<a href="http://www.lelystichting.nl/" sl-processed="1">http://www.lelystichting.nl</a>) and the Supporting campaign for Civil Engineering.</p>

		<h1>People</h1>
		<h2>Anke Rolvink<h2>
		<p>Anke Rolvink (1983) started her PhD research project in December 2010 at the BEMNext laboratory. Her research focuses on the development of new intelligent design tools for early design stages. The aim of the research is to develop new computational strategies and technologies to innovate the building design process, with a focus on safety in the earliest stages of design.
			<br><br>Besides her PhD thesis Anke worked as a structural engineer and computational designer at Arup Amsterdam. Here she was involved in various design and research projects, mostly related to computational design.
			<br><br>Besides her PhD thesis, Anke is co-founder of <a href="www.white-lioness.nl">White Lioness technologies</a>, a young technology company with the mission to build new and exciting applications that will change the way we use computers and devices in business and in our day-to-day lives. Their expertise lies in scalable applications, related to high-performance, distributed and cloud computing as well as information management for large and complex projects.
			<br><br>During her Master thesis, finished in 2010, she developed StructuralComponents2.0, a toolbox for the designing structural engineer.</p>
		<h2>Jeroen Coenders</h2>
		<p>Jeroen Coenders (1978) graduated from Delft University of Technology with honours in 2004 on Form Finding and Structural Optimisation. In 2004 he started his PhD research into a next generation of structural design tools and NetworkedDesign. At the Faculty of Civil Engineering he co-founded and headed the Structural Design Lab, which serves over 35 graduate students in the past five years. 
			<br><br>After his graduation Jeroen also joined Arup as a structural engineer. In his period with Arup he started a computation team in Amsterdam and coordinated Virtual Design in Europe. Jeroen was involved in many large projects (such as the Guangzhou TV & Sightseeing Tower) for which he developed many tools and worked as project manager. 
			<br><br>Together with Anke Rolvink he started his company <a href="www.white-lioness.nl">White Lioness technologies</a> in September 2013. The companies mission is to build new and exciting applications that will change the way we use computers and devices in business and in our day-to-day lives. Their expertise lies in scalable applications, related to high-performance, distributed and cloud computing as well as information management for large and complex projects
