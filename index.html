			   <h1>NetworkedDesign</h1>
		   </div>
		<h3>by Jeroen Coenders</h3>  
		<p>NetworkedDesign is a novel computational infrastructure for the tools of the future. It combines many paradigms and concepts in a single approach on which a large variety of frameworks, applications and tools can be built. NetworkedDesign is one of the core technologies which we will be employing in our other projects.</p>

			   <h1>Structural safety tools for early design stages</h1>
		   </div>
		<h3>by Anke Rolvink</h3>   
		<p>The aim of this project is to develop new computational strategies and technologies with a focus on safety in the earliest stages of design. The development of design tools which are able to determine the distribution of probability and can present possible failure scenarios can assist the building engineer in designing a structural system.</p>

			   <h1>Parametric tools for sustainability</h1>
		   </div>
		<h3>by Jeroen Coenders</h3>   
		<p>The aim of this project is to build an open framework for parametric design tools which help you to design sustainable buildings. The framework will help designers by providing a workflow in which various components can be used. Several of these components will be built by the BEMNext Lab as a proof-of-concept, but users will be able to build their own components and use them with the framework.
</br></br>On this project, we are collaborating with Bouwen met Staal (Dutch Steel Institute), Tata steel and Arup.

				  <h1>Design systems</h1>
				</div>
			<h3>by Jeroen Coenders</h3> 
			<p>Many systems exists which can be used during the design process, but still there exists a large gap in the systems available to design and what they are capable of doing.
The aim of this research project is to find out what is required to support design, to research capabilities in existing systems, to critique the current capabilities, to propose new capabilities and to develop new systems.</p>

		<h1>Beyond BIM</h1>
		<h3>by Jeroen Coenders</h3>  
		<p>The capabilities of Building Information Modelling (BIM) systems are growing fast, but the application of these systems in practice still remains limited to a particular part of the life-cycle of the building: roughly between the engineering phase and hand-over of the building to the client. Although the vision of BIM (see for instance this movie clip in Dutch about BIM: http://vimeo.com/25454681) is much more wider and further-reaching, the software lags behind and it can be questioned if this underlying paradigm (object orientation) is not too limiting.
The aim of this project is to research and propose what is required for the next generation of BIM software to get closer to the vision.</p>
		<h4><b>Subproject:</b>BIM for the design and planning phases, BIM for the construction phases, BIM for the lifecycle, BIM for infrastructure</h4>

		<h1>Asset management</h1>
		<h3>by Jeroen Coenders</h3>   
		<p>The aim of this project is to research new approaches and develop new systems for asset management of the built environment: buildings, infrastructure (road, rail, water), the green environment, regions, cities, etc.
By employing new technology combined with existing domain knowledge new opportunities for better management of these asset arise.</p>
